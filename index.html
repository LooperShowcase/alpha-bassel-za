      he National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is an
      independent agency of the US federal government responsible for the civil
      space program, aeronautics research, and space research.[note 1] NASA was
      established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for
      Aeronautics (NACA), to give the US space development effort a distinctly
      civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space
      science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most American space exploration
      efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions,
      the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting
      the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the
      Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and
      the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible
      for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch
      operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches. NASA's
      science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth
      Observing System;[10] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the
      Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;[11] exploring
      bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such
      as New Horizons;[12] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big
      Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs
